**Note:** All visualizations and outputs are generated directly from the notebooks. The notebooks contain all necessary code and can be executed independently.

## Dataset

**Synthetic Automotive Sales Dataset**
- **Size**: 2000 records
- **Time Period**: 2015-2023 (9 years)
- **Features**: 15 columns
  - Temporal: Year, Month, Season, Quarter
  - Vehicle: Vehicle_Type (8 types)
  - Geographic: Region, City, Latitude, Longitude
  - Sales: Sales, Price, Revenue
  - Economic: GDP, Unemployment_Rate, Recession
  - Marketing: Advertising_Expenditure

**Key Characteristics:**
- Realistic patterns and relationships
- Seasonal variations
- Recession periods (2020-2021)
- Geographic diversity (5 regions, 20 cities)
- Multiple vehicle types

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mapleleaflatte03/ibm_applied_data_dcience_capstone.git
cd ibm_applied_data_dcience_capstone
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly dash dash-bootstrap-components folium pandasql scikit-learn python-pptx pywin32
```

### 3. Run Notebooks

1. Start Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`
2. Open and run notebooks in order:
   - `notebooks/1_data_collection.ipynb` - Generate dataset
   - `notebooks/2_data_wrangling.ipynb` - Clean and prepare data
   - `notebooks/3_eda_analysis.ipynb` - Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
   - `notebooks/4_sql_eda.ipynb` - SQL-based analysis
   - `notebooks/5_predictive_analysis.ipynb` - Build classification models

**All outputs (visualizations, analysis results, models) are generated directly from the notebooks.**

## Project Components

### 1. Data Collection (`1_data_collection.ipynb`)
- Synthetic data generation
- Dataset characteristics overview
- Initial data inspection

### 2. Data Wrangling (`2_data_wrangling.ipynb`)
- Data cleaning and validation
- Missing value handling
- Feature engineering:
  - Date column creation
  - Price categories
  - Sales categories
  - Economic index
  - Quarterly features

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (`3_eda_analysis.ipynb`)
- Statistical summaries
- Visualizations:
  - Sales over time
  - Sales by vehicle type
  - Seasonal patterns
  - Correlation analysis
  - Recession impact
  - Regional analysis
  - Price vs Sales relationship

### 4. SQL-Based EDA (`4_sql_eda.ipynb`)
- SQL queries using pandasql
- Key queries:
  - Sales by vehicle type
  - Year-over-year growth
  - Top cities by revenue
  - Seasonal performance
  - Economic indicators impact
  - Advertising effectiveness

### 5. Predictive Analysis (`5_predictive_analysis.ipynb`)
- Classification task: Predict High/Low Sales
- Models evaluated:
  - Logistic Regression (85.0% accuracy)
  - Random Forest (87.5% accuracy)
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Accuracy, ROC-AUC
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Feature Importance
  - Classification Report

### 6. Interactive Visualizations

All interactive visualizations (Plotly Dash dashboard and Folium map) are included in the notebooks:
- Interactive dashboard code in notebook cells
- Folium map generation in notebook cells
- All visualizations can be generated by running the notebooks

### 7. Presentation

**PDF Presentation** (`IBM_Capstone_Presentation.pdf`)
- Complete slide deck covering all required sections:
  - Executive Summary
  - Introduction
  - Data Collection & Wrangling
  - EDA Results
  - SQL-Based EDA
  - Predictive Analysis Methodology & Results
  - Interactive Visualizations
  - Conclusion
  - Creative Insights

## Key Findings

### Sales Patterns
- **Vehicle Types**: SUV and Electric vehicles show highest average sales
- **Seasonal**: Summer shows peak sales (128 units), Winter lowest (92 units)
- **Regional**: West Coast (LA, SF) leads in sales, followed by East Coast (NY, Boston)

### Economic Impact
- **Recession**: 2020-2021 recession caused ~40% sales decline
- **GDP**: Higher GDP correlates with increased sales
- **Unemployment**: Lower unemployment rates lead to better sales

### Predictive Insights
- **Model Performance**: Random Forest achieves 87.5% accuracy
- **Key Features**: Price (21%), GDP (18%), Advertising (15%)
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.92 indicates excellent predictive capability

## Business Recommendations

1. **Focus on High-Performance Segments**: Prioritize SUV and Electric vehicle marketing
2. **Seasonal Planning**: Increase inventory in Spring/Summer, reduce in Winter
3. **Economic Monitoring**: Track GDP and unemployment rates for sales forecasting
4. **Advertising Strategy**: Maintain higher advertising spend during recovery periods
5. **Geographic Focus**: Allocate more resources to high-performing regions (West/East Coast)

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, Folium
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **SQL**: pandasql
- **Visualization**: Plotly, Folium, Matplotlib
- **Presentation**: python-pptx

## 📋 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of **SpaceX launch data** to predict **first stage landing success**. The analysis utilizes real data from the SpaceX public API, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), builds predictive classification models, and creates interactive visualizations.

**Main Objective:** Predict whether SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land after launch, which is crucial for cost reduction through rocket reusability.

  - Creative Insights

## Key Findings

### Sales Patterns
- **Vehicle Types**: SUV and Electric vehicles show highest average sales
- **Seasonal**: Summer shows peak sales (128 units), Winter lowest (92 units)
- **Regional**: West Coast (LA, SF) leads in sales, followed by East Coast (NY, Boston)

### Economic Impact
- **Recession**: 2020-2021 recession caused ~40% sales decline
- **GDP**: Higher GDP correlates with increased sales
- **Unemployment**: Lower unemployment rates lead to better sales

### Predictive Insights
- **Model Performance**: Random Forest achieves 87.5% accuracy
- **Key Features**: Price (21%), GDP (18%), Advertising (15%)
- **ROC-AUC**: 0.92 indicates excellent predictive capability

## Business Recommendations

1. **Focus on High-Performance Segments**: Prioritize SUV and Electric vehicle marketing
2. **Seasonal Planning**: Increase inventory in Spring/Summer, reduce in Winter
3. **Economic Monitoring**: Track GDP and unemployment rates for sales forecasting
4. **Advertising Strategy**: Maintain higher advertising spend during recovery periods
5. **Geographic Focus**: Allocate more resources to high-performing regions (West/East Coast)

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Dash, Folium
